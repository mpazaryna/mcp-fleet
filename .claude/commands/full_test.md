# Full Test Suite Command

Runs the complete four-tier testing hierarchy for MCP Fleet, ending with UAT validation.

## Test Hierarchy

This command executes tests in the proper order following TDD methodology:

1. **Unit Tests** - Individual component behavior with mocking
2. **Integration Tests** - Cross-component workflows and API testing  
3. **E2E Tests** - Full MCP protocol testing with Docker containers
4. **UAT Tests** - Real-world user scenarios with actual file creation

## Usage

```bash
/full-test
```

## What This Command Does

### Phase 1: Unit & Integration Tests
- Runs all unit and integration tests
- Validates individual components work correctly
- Ensures component interactions function properly

### Phase 2: E2E Tests  
- Tests the complete MCP protocol via Docker containers
- Validates MCPDockerClient framework
- Ensures proper JSON-RPC communication
- Tests tool calls and responses

### Phase 3: UAT Tests
- Runs real-world user acceptance scenarios
- Creates actual files on user's drive
- Validates Docker containers work without timeouts
- Confirms shared storage abstraction is working
- Final go/no-go validation for production

## Success Criteria

All tests must pass for the command to succeed:
- âœ… Unit/Integration tests pass
- âœ… E2E tests pass  
- âœ… UAT creates real files on disk
- âœ… No timeouts or hanging processes
- âœ… Shared storage abstraction confirmed working

## Output

The command provides clear progress indicators and final validation that the entire MCP Fleet system is ready for production use.
