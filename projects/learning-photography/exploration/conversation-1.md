# Exploration Session 1: learning photography

**Focus**: Complete initial problem exploration

## Session Start: 2025-06-14T19:40:27.401Z

**Claude**: Sounds good, let's begin systematically exploring the problem of learning photography before considering any solutions. I'll ask focused questions one at a time to thoroughly understand the real problem you're trying to solve.

1. Problem Definition
To start, what is the specific problem you're trying to solve by learning photography? What motivated you to want to learn it in the first place?

**You**: i want to learn to be a better photographer and use the gear i have better

**Claude**: Okay, wanting to improve your photography skills and get more out of your existing gear is a reasonable goal. A few follow-up questions on the problem definition:

- What level are you currently at with photography? Complete beginner, some experience, etc?
- What are your motivations for wanting to improve? Is it just a hobby/creative outlet, or do you have goals like shooting events, building a portfolio, etc?
- What types of photography are you most interested in improving at (portraits, landscapes, action shots, etc)?

Getting clarity on your current baseline, motivations, and specific photography interests will help define the problem space more clearly. The solutions may look quite different depending on those factors.

**You**: some experience, mostly outdoor and landscape, hobby and want to improve, i want to build pdf photo zines to share with family and friends

**Claude**: Got it, that provides helpful additional context. To summarize the problem definition:

You have some prior photography experience, primarily with outdoor/landscape photography. Your motivation is hobbyist/creative fulfillment, with a specific goal of creating PDF photo zines to share with family and friends. You want to improve your skills and get more out of your existing gear to take better outdoor/landscape photos for these zines.

Does this accurately capture the core problem you're trying to solve by learning more about photography? Or is there any other important context missing in defining the real problem?
