## Core Problem Definition
What problem are we actually solving?

**Surface problem**: 
*Write the obvious, immediate problem statement here*

**Deeper problems**: 
*What underlying issues might this surface problem represent?*

**Why is this important now?**:
*What makes this urgent or timely?*

## Assumptions to Challenge
What are we assuming about this situation?

**Assumption 1**: 
*State a key assumption you're making*
- Evidence supporting this assumption:
- Evidence that might challenge this assumption:

**Assumption 2**:
*State another key assumption*
- Evidence supporting this assumption:
- Evidence that might challenge this assumption:

## Edge Cases & Failure Modes
What could go wrong or not work as expected?

**Edge case 1**: 
*Describe a scenario where the obvious solution might not work*

**Edge case 2**:
*Describe another challenging scenario*

**Primary failure mode**:
*What's the most likely way this could fail completely?*

## Integration & Constraints  
What real-world factors affect this?

**Existing systems/processes**:
*What do you already have in place that this needs to work with?*

**Time constraints**:
*What are the real deadlines and time pressures?*

**Resource constraints**:
*What limitations exist in terms of people, budget, tools?*

**Stakeholder constraints**:
*Who needs to be involved and what are their requirements?*

## The "Hard Stuff"
What makes this problem more complex than it initially appears?

**Technical complexity**:
*What technical challenges are lurking beneath the surface?*

**Organizational complexity**:
*What people/process issues might emerge?*

**Domain complexity**:
*What specialized knowledge or expertise is required?*
