## Session Start: 2025-06-15T13:03:50.210Z

**Claude**: Great, let's begin our systematic exploration of the problem space for this project. I'll ask focused questions to better understand the real problem we're trying to solve and any hidden complexities we need to consider.

To start, can you describe in your own words what you see as the core problem this project aims to address? What is the high-level goal or outcome you're hoping to achieve?
