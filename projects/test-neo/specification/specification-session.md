# Specification Session: test-neo

**Goal**: Transform exploration insights into structured specifications

## Session Start: 2025-06-15T13:36:59.254Z

**Claude**: Understood, based on the exploration insights, I will create the initial specification documents for the test-neo project, starting with the learning syllabus structure and requirements specification:

Learning Syllabus Structure:

1. Foundations of Photo Editing
    a. Introduction to Luminar Neo interface
    b. Importing and organizing photos
    c. Basic exposure and color adjustments
    d. Cropping, straightening, and geometric transformations

2. Core Editing Techniques 
    a. Layering and masking
    b. Selective adjustments with filters
    c. Color grading and stylization
    d. Sharpening and noise reduction

3. Creative Photo Manipulations
    a. Blending and compositing
    b. Adding textures and overlays  
    c. Replacing skies and backgrounds
    d. Creating double exposures

4. Before/After Project
    a. Select 4 photos to edit
    b. Apply skills from previous modules
    c. Compile before/after examples
    d. Create photography zine PDF

Requirements Specification:

1. Develop beginner-level proficiency in Luminar Neo photo editing software
2. Build understanding of core editing concepts like layers, masking, filters
3. Learn creative manipulation techniques like compositing and texture blending
4. Produce a small photography zine with 4 before/after edited photo examples 
5. Curriculum self-paced with estimated timeline based on available time commitment
6. Leverage existing Luminar Neo tutorials supplemented with custom practice exercises
7. Include a tracking system to measure progress through curriculum modules
8. Final zine deliverable must follow a consistent artistic theme/style

This outlines the initial learning syllabus structure broken into modules, as well as key requirements the curriculum must meet based on the exploration insights. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements to incorporate.

**You**: looks good

**Claude**: Okay, great. Since the learning syllabus structure and requirements specification look good, let's move on to defining the acceptance criteria and deliverables list:

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Foundations of Photo Editing
   - Can import, browse, and apply basic edits to photos in Luminar Neo
   - Understands concepts like exposure, levels, curves, cropping
   - Has completed practice exercises for each foundational technique

2. Core Editing Techniques
   - Can create and manipulate adjustment layers 
   - Understands how to use masks, filters, and selective adjustments
   - Has applied techniques like color grading and sharpening to sample images

3. Creative Photo Manipulations 
   - Can blend and composite multiple images together
   - Understands how to replace backgrounds, skies and add textures/overlays
   - Has created double exposure and other creative edits

4. Before/After Project
   - Has selected 4 photos that demonstrate skills from all modules
   - Before/after versions compiled into coherent photography zine PDF
   - Zine follows a consistent creative theme/visual style
   - Can explain editing process and techniques used for each photo

Deliverables List:

1. Completed practice files for all modules
2. Luminar Neo workspace backups at key milestones 
3. 4 individual before/after edited photo pairs
4. Compiled photography zine PDF with:
    - Title page
    - Before/after pages for each photo 
    - Descriptions of editing process
5. Learner's self-evaluation of progress through curriculum

Let me know if any part of the acceptance criteria or deliverables list needs to be modified or expanded based on the requirements.

**You**: i think we're done

**Claude**: Sounds good, thanks for the feedback. I've captured the key specification documents based on the exploration insights:

1. Learning Syllabus Structure
2. Requirements Specification 
3. Acceptance Criteria
4. Deliverables List

Since you confirmed these look complete, we can consider the specification phase wrapped up for the test-neo beginner Luminar Neo curriculum project. 

The next step would be to hand off these structured specifications to the execution team or process. They now have a clear set of defined requirements, measurable acceptance criteria, and expected deliverables to build out the actual curriculum content and learning materials.

My role in the specification phase is complete. Please let me know if any other specification artifacts are needed before transitioning to the execution workflow. Otherwise, I'll conclude my tasks for transforming the exploration insights into comprehensive specifications here.
