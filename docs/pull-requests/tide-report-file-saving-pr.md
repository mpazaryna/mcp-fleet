# Pull Request: Tide Report File Saving Feature

## Summary

Adds comprehensive file saving and export capabilities to the Tides MCP server, enabling users to persist tide reports outside Docker containers with secure volume mounting.

## Changes Made

### 🆕 New MCP Tools
- **`save_tide_report`** - Save individual tide reports in JSON, Markdown, or CSV format
- **`export_all_tides`** - Batch export multiple tides with filtering options

### 📊 Report Generation Features
- **JSON Format**: Structured data with statistics and flow history
- **Markdown Format**: Human-readable reports with tables and formatting  
- **CSV Format**: Data export for spreadsheet analysis
- **Automatic timestamping** and organized directory structure
- **Flow statistics**: Total flows, average duration, intensity distribution

### 🐳 Docker Integration
- **Volume mount support** for `/app/reports` directory
- **Secure file access** with controlled permissions
- **Updated Dockerfile** with reports directory creation
- **Enhanced docker-compose** with persistent volumes
- **Deployment script updates** for automatic reports directory setup

### 🔧 Configuration Updates
- **Claude Desktop config** with volume mount for `~/Documents/TideReports`
- **Docker MCP Toolkit** compatible resource limits maintained
- **Environment variable** support for flexible deployment

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
Claude Desktop → MCP Protocol → Tides Container → Volume Mount → Host Files
```

### File Structure
```
/app/reports/
├── tides/
│   ├── daily/
│   ├── weekly/
│   ├── project/
│   └── seasonal/
```

### Security Considerations
- ✅ Container isolation maintained (1 CPU, 2GB RAM)
- ✅ Limited filesystem access to reports directory only
- ✅ No host system access outside mounted volume
- ✅ Proper file permissions and directory creation

## Testing Results

### ✅ Container Build & Deployment
- [x] Docker image builds successfully
- [x] Volume mounts configured correctly
- [x] Reports directory created automatically
- [x] MCP Toolkit resource limits respected

### ✅ Functionality Testing
- [x] Tide report generation works
- [x] Multiple export formats supported
- [x] File saving to host directory
- [x] Batch export capabilities
- [x] Statistics generation accurate

### ⚠️ Known Issues
- TypeScript compilation warnings in MCP core (non-blocking)
- Report tools may require server restart to register (investigating)

## Usage Examples

### Save Individual Report
```bash
# In Claude Desktop
"Save a JSON report for my Morning Reflection tide"
```

### Batch Export
```bash  
# In Claude Desktop
"Export all my daily tides as Markdown reports"
```

### File Locations
Reports saved to: `~/Documents/TideReports/tides/{flow_type}/`

## Breaking Changes
None - fully backward compatible with existing Tides functionality.

## Documentation Updates
- [x] Updated specification document
- [x] Enhanced deployment scripts
- [x] Docker configuration examples
- [x] Claude Desktop integration guide

## Next Steps
1. Resolve TypeScript compilation warnings
2. Add integration tests for file operations
3. Consider adding custom report templates
4. Explore cloud storage integration options
