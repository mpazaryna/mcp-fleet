# 2025-06-27: Architecture Cleanup and Standardization

## Summary
Major cleanup session focusing on folder structure, Docker simplification, and documentation organization.

## Key Changes

### Folder Structure Standardization
- Renamed `python-packages/` → `packages/` 
- Renamed `python-servers/` → `servers/`
- Removed "python-" prefixes for cleaner navigation
- Updated all configuration files (pyproject.toml, Dockerfile, GitHub Actions)

### Docker Infrastructure Cleanup  
- Consolidated `Dockerfile.all-python` → `Dockerfile` (standard naming)
- Removed redundant docker-compose.yml and individual Dockerfiles
- Removed manual deployment script (CI/CD handles everything)
- Simplified build commands (no `-f` flag needed)

### OF Server Removal
- Removed problematic Orchestration Framework server
- Template engine was causing deployment complexity
- Focused on core stable servers: tides, compass, memry
- Updated GitHub Actions to remove OF build targets

### Documentation Reorganization
- Created AI-friendly docs structure: `/specs`, `/adr`, `/devlog`
- Added Architecture Decision Records for major decisions
- Organized for better AI assistant context

## Performance Impact
- Docker builds still work correctly with new structure
- GitHub Actions successfully building and publishing
- Repository size reduced by removing unused files

## AI Context Notes
- Monorepo pattern follows Cloudflare's MCP server approach
- Focus on "showcase open source" rather than contribution-heavy
- Architecture optimized for AI-assisted development workflows

## Next Steps
- Consider making repository public
- Continue focusing on stable server implementations
- Document any future architectural decisions in ADR format
