# Tides - Rhythmic Workflow Management

Tides is an MCP server that brings natural rhythm and sustainability to productivity workflows. Inspired by tidal patterns in nature, it helps create balanced work cycles that prevent burnout while maintaining consistent progress.

## Philosophy

Traditional productivity systems often promote unsustainable intensity or rigid scheduling. Tides embraces the natural ebb and flow of energy, attention, and creativity. Like ocean tides, work has natural rhythms - periods of high energy flow followed by necessary rest and reflection.

## Core Concepts

### Tidal Flows
Work sessions organized around natural energy patterns:
- **Gentle**: Low-intensity, reflective work (planning, reading, organizing)
- **Moderate**: Steady progress on established tasks (coding, writing, processing)
- **Strong**: High-focus, challenging work (problem-solving, creative tasks, deep work)

### Time Scales
Different rhythms for different needs:
- **Daily**: 2-4 hour flows within a day
- **Weekly**: 1-3 day focused periods
- **Project**: Multi-week intensive phases
- **Seasonal**: Quarterly themes and major initiatives

### Flow States
- **Rising**: Building momentum, preparing for work
- **Peak**: Maximum focus and productivity
- **Ebbing**: Winding down, reflection, completion
- **Rest**: Recovery, planning, inspiration gathering

## Features

### Tide Creation and Management
- Create custom tidal workflows with specific intensities and durations
- Track multiple concurrent tides (daily habits + project sprints)
- Monitor flow state transitions and energy patterns

### Intelligent Flow Sessions
- Start focused work sessions aligned with your current energy
- Automatic intensity recommendations based on time of day and recent activity
- Natural transition prompts between flow states

### Rich Reporting and Analytics
- Export comprehensive reports in JSON, Markdown, or CSV formats
- Track productivity patterns over time
- Identify optimal work rhythms and energy cycles
- Historical analysis of flow effectiveness

### Persistent Storage
- All tide data preserved across sessions
- Docker volume mounting for data persistence
- Backup and export capabilities for long-term tracking

## Use Cases

### Daily Rhythm Management
Create a daily tide that follows your natural energy:
- Morning gentle flows for planning and email
- Mid-morning strong flows for challenging work
- Afternoon moderate flows for execution
- Evening gentle flows for reflection

### Project Sprints
Establish project-specific tides:
- Week-long strong tide for new feature development
- Seasonal moderate tide for system maintenance
- Quarterly gentle tide for learning and research

### Habit Formation
Use gentle daily tides to build sustainable habits:
- Morning writing practice
- Evening reflection and planning
- Weekly review and goal adjustment

### Creative Cycles
Align creative work with natural rhythms:
- Strong tides for breakthrough sessions
- Gentle tides for inspiration gathering
- Moderate tides for craft refinement

## MCP Tools

### Core Tools
- `create_tide`: Design new tidal workflows
- `list_tides`: View and filter existing tides
- `flow_tide`: Begin focused work sessions

### Reporting Tools
- `save_tide_report`: Export individual tide analysis
- `export_all_tides`: Batch export with filtering options

## Getting Started

Tides works best when you start small and gradually build awareness of your natural rhythms. Begin with a simple daily tide, observe your energy patterns, then expand to weekly and project-scale flows.

The key is sustainability - Tides should feel supportive, not demanding. Like natural tides, the rhythm should feel inevitable and restful, not forced or stressful.
