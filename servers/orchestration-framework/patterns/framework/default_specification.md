# {{PROJECT_NAME}} - Specification

## Insights Summary

Based on the exploration phase, here are the key insights discovered:

{{EXPLORATION_INSIGHTS}}

### Key Findings:
- **User Pain Points**: {{USER_PAIN_POINTS}}
- **Core Requirements**: {{CORE_FEATURES}}
- **Constraints**: {{CONSTRAINTS}}
- **Success Criteria**: {{SUCCESS_CRITERIA}}

## Behavioral Scenarios

The following Gherkin scenarios define the expected behaviors and outcomes for this project:

### Core Functionality Scenarios

```gherkin
Feature: {{PROJECT_NAME}} Core Functionality

Background:
  Given the system is properly set up
  And all prerequisites are met

Scenario: Basic user interaction
  Given a user wants to {{GOALS}}
  When they interact with the system
  Then they should achieve their desired outcome
  And the experience should address their pain points

Scenario: Success criteria validation
  Given the implementation is complete
  When we measure against success criteria
  Then we should see {{SUCCESS_CRITERIA}}
  And constraints should be respected: {{CONSTRAINTS}}
```

### User Experience Scenarios

```gherkin
Feature: User Experience and Satisfaction

Scenario: Addressing user pain points
  Given users currently experience: {{USER_PAIN_POINTS}}
  When they use the new solution
  Then these pain points should be resolved
  And user satisfaction should improve

Scenario: Core feature utilization
  Given users need: {{CORE_FEATURES}}
  When the features are implemented
  Then users should be able to accomplish their goals
  And the features should be intuitive and accessible
```

### Implementation Validation Scenarios

```gherkin
Feature: Implementation Requirements

Scenario: Constraint compliance
  Given the implementation must respect: {{CONSTRAINTS}}
  When the solution is built
  Then it should operate within these constraints
  And not violate any limitations

Scenario: Technical feasibility
  Given the technical considerations: {{TECHNICAL_CONSIDERATIONS}}
  When implementing the solution
  Then the architecture should support the requirements
  And be maintainable and scalable
```

## Next Steps

Based on this specification:

1. **Review scenarios** with stakeholders for accuracy and completeness
2. **Refine behavioral definitions** based on feedback
3. **Begin execution phase** using these scenarios as acceptance criteria
4. **Validate implementation** against the defined behaviors

## Acceptance Criteria

The implementation will be considered complete when:
- [ ] All Gherkin scenarios pass validation
- [ ] User pain points identified in exploration are addressed
- [ ] Core features function as specified
- [ ] Success criteria can be measured and achieved
- [ ] All constraints are respected in the final solution
