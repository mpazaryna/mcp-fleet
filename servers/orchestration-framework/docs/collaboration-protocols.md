# Collaboration Protocols

## Purpose
This document defines the human-AI collaboration patterns within the Orchestration Framework. It establishes clear roles, interaction methods, and communication protocols that maximize the strengths of both human strategic thinking and AI execution capabilities.

## Application
Use this context to establish proper human-AI collaboration in any framework application, ensuring optimal role distribution and effective handoffs between phases.

## Integration
Works with core/methodology.md and core/completion-criteria.md to define how collaboration should occur within the systematic framework approach.

## Fundamental Collaboration Principle

### Human as Conductor, AI as Orchestra
**Human Role**: Strategic oversight, problem framing, context understanding, quality validation
**AI Role**: Systematic execution, comprehensive analysis, intensive implementation work
**Partnership**: Humans provide orchestration and direction; AI provides capability and thoroughness

**Not Replacement**: This is collaboration that leverages complementary strengths, not AI replacing human judgment or humans micromanaging AI execution.

- **Deliverable Creation**: Produce working solutions that meet acceptance criteria

#### Collaboration Protocol
1. **AI Executes** against specifications with minimal human intervention
2. **Human Monitors** progress and provides guidance on strategic questions
3. **AI Communicates** significant challenges or specification ambiguities
4. **Human Provides** course corrections while maintaining specification integrity
5. **Both Validate** execution completion criteria before considering phase complete

### Feedback & Learning Phase Collaboration

#### Human Responsibilities
- **Outcome Assessment**: Evaluate whether solution actually solves the original problem
- **Process Reflection**: Assess what worked well and what could be improved in methodology
- **Strategic Learning**: Extract insights that apply to broader goals and future projects
- **Framework Refinement**: Identify improvements to the collaboration process itself
- **Knowledge Integration**: Ensure learnings are captured for organizational benefit

#### AI Responsibilities
- **Systematic Analysis**: Objectively assess what worked and what didn't in the process
- **Pattern Extraction**: Identify reusable patterns and common failure modes
- **Documentation**: Capture insights in formats useful for future applications
- **Methodology Improvement**: Suggest refinements to framework application
- **Knowledge Synthesis**: Organize learnings for integration into framework knowledge base

#### Collaboration Protocol
1. **Both Assess** solution quality and process effectiveness
2. **AI Analyzes** systematic patterns and improvement opportunities
3. **Human Provides** strategic context and business/personal impact assessment
4. **AI Documents** insights for future framework applications
5. **Both Plan** integration of learnings into improved methodology

## Communication Protocols

### Effective Human-to-AI Communication

#### Context Provision
- **Be Specific**: Provide concrete constraints, deadlines, and quality standards
- **Share Failures**: Describe past attempts and what didn't work
- **Explain Priorities**: Clarify what matters most when trade-offs are required
- **Surface Assumptions**: State what you're assuming about the problem or solution
- **Provide Examples**: Give concrete examples of success and failure

#### Guidance Patterns
- **"The real challenge here is..."** - Direct AI attention to core complexity
- **"What we tried before that didn't work..."** - Prevent repeated failures
- **"The stakeholders really care about..."** - Focus on actual priorities
- **"This needs to integrate with..."** - Ensure real-world compatibility
- **"Good enough means..."** - Set appropriate quality standards

### Effective AI-to-Human Communication

#### Exploration Communication
- **Ask Clarifying Questions**: "What constraints am I missing?" "Who else is affected by this?"
- **Surface Assumptions**: "I'm assuming X, is that correct?" "What if Y were different?"
- **Identify Gaps**: "I need more information about..." "This area seems unclear..."
- **Propose Hypotheses**: "It seems like the real problem might be..." "Could this actually be about...?"

#### Specification Communication
- **Present Options**: "Here are three approaches, each with these trade-offs..."
- **Highlight Dependencies**: "This specification assumes..." "This will require..."
- **Identify Risks**: "The biggest implementation risk is..." "This could fail if..."
- **Seek Validation**: "Does this specification address the real requirements?"

#### Execution Communication
- **Progress Updates**: "I've completed X, working on Y, blocked on Z..."
- **Challenge Identification**: "The specification is unclear about..." "I'm encountering this constraint..."
- **Quality Questions**: "This implementation meets the specification but..." "Would you prefer A or B approach?"
- **Completion Validation**: "This solution addresses requirements X, Y, Z. Ready for your review."

## Handoff Protocols

### Phase Transition Handoffs

#### Exploration to Specification Handoff
- **Human Validates**: Exploration completion criteria are met
- **AI Summarizes**: Key insights and complexity discovered
- **Human Confirms**: Strategic priorities for specification phase
- **AI Proceeds**: With clear understanding of what to specify

#### Specification to Execution Handoff
- **Human Approves**: Specifications adequately address exploration insights
- **AI Confirms**: Understanding of requirements and success criteria
- **Human Clarifies**: Any remaining ambiguities or priorities
- **AI Executes**: With minimal need for additional guidance

#### Execution to Learning Handoff
- **Human Accepts**: Solution meets real-world requirements
- **AI Documents**: Implementation approach and challenges encountered
- **Human Reflects**: On process effectiveness and outcomes
- **Both Integrate**: Learnings into improved methodology

### Quality Control Handoffs

#### When AI Should Escalate to Human
- Exploration reveals significantly more complexity than expected
- Specifications seem to contradict each other or exploration insights
- Execution encounters constraints not addressed in specifications
- Implementation approach would violate framework principles

#### When Human Should Guide AI
- Strategic priorities need clarification or adjustment
- Real-world constraints change during process
- Stakeholder feedback requires specification or execution changes
- Quality standards need adjustment based on evolving understanding
