# Orchestration Framework

## Purpose
This is the core Orchestration Framework context for AI-assisted knowledge work. Include these files to enable systematic exploration-to-execution methodology that prevents surface-level solutions and ensures production-ready outcomes.

## Module Contents

### [overview.md](./overview.md)
**Human-readable framework introduction**
- Complete framework philosophy and rationale
- Team structure and expected outcomes
- Application domains and success metrics
- Use for: Understanding the framework before applying it

### [methodology.md](./methodology.md) 
**Core systematic process for AI agents**
- Four-phase framework (Exploration → Specification → Execution → Feedback)
- AI agent roles and responsibilities in each phase
- Key questions and systematic approaches
- Use for: Any framework application requiring systematic methodology

### [completion-criteria.md](./completion-criteria.md)
**Implementation rules and quality gates**
- Mandatory completion criteria for each phase
- Quality gates preventing premature advancement
- Framework integrity checks and failure prevention
- Use for: Ensuring rigorous framework application and preventing shortcuts

### [collaboration-protocols.md](./collaboration-protocols.md)
**Human-AI interaction patterns**
- Phase-specific collaboration responsibilities
- Communication protocols and handoff procedures
- Anti-patterns to avoid in human-AI collaboration
- Use for: Optimizing human-AI collaboration within framework structure

### [self-review.md](./self-review.md)
**Continuous improvement and learning integration**
- Systematic learning capture from each application
- Framework evolution and knowledge building
- Pattern recognition and methodology refinement
- Use for: Ensuring framework applications improve organizational capability

## Context Selection Guide

### Minimum Viable Context
**For simple applications:** `methodology.md` + `completion-criteria.md`
- Provides core systematic process with quality enforcement
- Prevents surface solutions and ensures thorough exploration

### Standard Context  
**For most applications:** `methodology.md` + `completion-criteria.md` + `collaboration-protocols.md`
- Adds optimized human-AI collaboration patterns
- Recommended for any multi-phase framework application

### Complete Context
**For complex applications or framework learning:** All five files
- Full framework capability with continuous improvement
- Use when training on framework or tackling complex problems

### Human Learning Context
**For understanding the framework:** `overview.md` first, then other modules as needed
- Start with big picture, then drill into specific implementation guidance

## Common Usage Patterns

### "Help me plan X using the Orchestration Framework"
**Include:** `methodology.md` + `completion-criteria.md`
**Context:** "Use the Orchestration Framework to systematically plan [X]. Follow the four-phase methodology and completion criteria."

### "Let's apply OF to solve this problem"  
**Include:** `methodology.md` + `completion-criteria.md` + `collaboration-protocols.md`
**Context:** "Apply the Orchestration Framework to this problem. Follow systematic methodology with proper human-AI collaboration."

### "Help me do a retrospective using OF principles"
**Include:** `self-review.md` + `methodology.md`
**Context:** "Use Orchestration Framework self-review process to analyze this project and capture learnings."

### "I'm new to the Orchestration Framework"
**Include:** `overview.md` + `methodology.md`  
**Context:** "I'm learning the Orchestration Framework. Help me understand how to apply it to [specific situation]."

## Framework Application Checklist

### Before Starting Any Framework Application
- [ ] Appropriate context files are included in conversation
- [ ] Problem or goal is clearly stated
- [ ] Any domain-specific context is identified
- [ ] Success criteria for this application are understood

### During Framework Application
- [ ] Following systematic four-phase methodology
- [ ] Meeting completion criteria before advancing phases
- [ ] Maintaining proper human-AI collaboration protocols
- [ ] Capturing insights for learning integration

### After Framework Application
- [ ] Conducting systematic self-review
- [ ] Documenting lessons learned
- [ ] Identifying framework improvements
- [ ] Integrating insights into organizational knowledge



## Quality Assurance

### Framework Context Validation
When including framework context in AI conversations:
- Verify all referenced files are included
- Ensure context combination makes sense for the application
- Confirm AI agent understands framework principles
- Validate that systematic methodology is being followed

### Outcome Quality Indicators  
Successful framework application should produce:
- Solutions that address real complexity, not just surface requirements
- Systematic exploration that reveals non-obvious insights
- Specifications that enable quality execution
- Learning that improves future framework applications
