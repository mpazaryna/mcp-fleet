# MCP Integration for Orchestration Framework

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration transforms the Orchestration Framework from a command-line tool into a conversational, Claude Desktop-native experience. This enables users to manage systematic project methodology through natural conversation while preserving all the sophisticated underlying logic.

## Architecture

### MCP as Facade Pattern
- **CLI Remains**: All existing commands (`deno task init`, `deno task explore`, etc.) continue to work
- **MCP Wraps**: The MCP server provides conversational access to the same functionality
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Power users can still use the CLI directly
- **Additive Value**: MCP adds guided, conversational project methodology

### Conversation Continuity
The MCP server enables persistent project conversations across multiple Claude Desktop sessions:
- **Project Memory**: Full conversation history accessible across sessions
- **Context Preservation**: Previous insights inform new conversations
- **Session Building**: Each conversation deepens project understanding
- **Smart Resumption**: Claude can pick up projects weeks later with full context

## MCP Tools Available

### Project Management
- `init_project(name)` - Initialize new project with 4-phase structure
- `list_projects()` - Show all projects with status information
- `get_project_status(project_name?)` - Detailed project status and recommendations

### Conversation Continuity
- `get_project_context(project_name)` - Load full conversation history
- `start_exploration(project_name?, focus_area?)` - Begin/continue exploration phase
- `save_exploration_session(project_name, conversation_content, summary?)` - Capture exploration conversations to files
- `complete_exploration_phase(project_name, completion_reason?)` - Mark exploration complete even with remaining tasks

### Specification Generation
- `generate_specification(project_name?, pattern?)` - Pattern-based spec generation
- `list_patterns()` - Available specification patterns

### Flywheel System

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Dependencies are already configured in deno.json
deno cache mcp_main.ts
```

### 2. Configure Claude Desktop
Add to your Claude Desktop MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "orchestration-framework": {
      "command": "deno",
      "args": ["run", "--allow-all", "/path/to/orchestration-framework/mcp_main.ts"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/orchestration-framework"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Start Claude Desktop
The MCP server will automatically start when Claude Desktop connects.

## Usage Examples

### Starting a New Project
```
User: I want to start a systematic approach to redesigning our customer onboarding

Claude: I'll initialize an Orchestration Framework project for this. 
        [calls init_project("customer-onboarding-redesign")]
        
        âœ… Project initialized with 4-phase methodology:
        â€¢ Exploration â†’ Specification â†’ Execution â†’ Feedback
        
        Let's begin systematic exploration. What's the current onboarding 
        experience like for your customers?
```

### Resuming Previous Work
```
User: Let's continue working on my onboarding project

Claude: [calls get_project_context("customer-onboarding-redesign")]
        
        Welcome back! I see we've had 3 exploration sessions on this project.
        From our previous conversations, you identified:
        â€¢ Users drop off at SMS verification (Session 1)  
        â€¢ Mobile UX has specific pain points (Session 2)
        â€¢ Verification flow needs simplification (Session 3)
        
        Would you like to:
        1. Generate a specification based on our exploration
        2. Explore mobile verification flow deeper
        3. Start a new exploration area
```

### Capturing Exploration Sessions
```
User: Let's save this conversation to the project files

Claude: [calls save_exploration_session("customer-onboarding-redesign", conversation_content)]
        
        âœ… Exploration session 1 saved successfully
        
        â€¢ Conversation captured in exploration/conversation-1.md
        â€¢ Session count updated in project metadata
        â€¢ Content available for future specification generation
```

### Completing Exploration Phase
```
User: I feel like I've explored enough. Let's move to creating a specification.

Claude: [calls complete_exploration_phase("customer-onboarding-redesign", "Sufficient insights gathered on user pain points and verification flow")]
        
        âœ… Exploration phase marked complete. 3 remaining tasks marked as complete.
        
        â€¢ Exploration phase completed by user decision
        â€¢ Completion reason recorded in exploration/completion-override.md
        â€¢ Ready to generate specification
```

## Conclusion

The MCP integration represents a fundamental transformation of the Orchestration Framework from a CLI tool into a conversational, AI-native methodology system. It preserves all existing functionality while making systematic project work accessible through natural conversation with Claude Desktop.

This creates the potential for the Orchestration Framework to become **the definitive way to do systematic project work with Claude** - enabling anyone to leverage sophisticated methodology through simple conversation.

## Troubleshooting

### Project Storage Location
Projects created via MCP are stored in `~/OrchestrationProjects/` (your home directory) rather than the framework's `projects/` directory. This ensures:
- Reliable permissions when running from Claude Desktop
- User-accessible project files regardless of framework installation location
- Consistent behavior across different operating systems

### Methodology Enforcement
The MCP server includes built-in guardrails:
- **Specification generation** requires completed exploration tasks
- **Clear phase indicators** in all tool responses
- **Guided next actions** that reinforce the systematic approach

If Claude tries to jump to implementation, the MCP tools will provide clear error messages explaining what exploration is needed first.
