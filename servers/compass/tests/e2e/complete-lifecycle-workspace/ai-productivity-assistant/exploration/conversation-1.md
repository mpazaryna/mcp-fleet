**USER:** I want to build an AI-powered productivity assistant that helps knowledge workers manage their tasks, research, and decision-making. What should I explore?

**ASSISTANT:** Great concept! An AI-powered productivity assistant is a complex system with many considerations. Let me help you explore the key areas systematically:

## Core Functionality & Features
1. **Task Management Intelligence**
   - AI-powered task prioritization based on deadlines, importance, and context
   - Smart scheduling that adapts to your work patterns and energy levels
   - Automatic task breakdown for complex projects
   - Integration with existing productivity tools (Notion, Asana, Todoist)

2. **Research & Knowledge Management**
   - Intelligent document summarization and extraction
   - Cross-reference finding across your knowledge base
   - Research assistant that can gather and synthesize information
   - Personal knowledge graph that learns from your interactions

3. **Decision Support System**
   - Decision framework recommendations based on decision type
   - Pros/cons analysis with weighted criteria
   - Historical decision tracking and outcome analysis
   - Bias detection and mitigation suggestions

## Technical Architecture Considerations
- **AI Model Strategy**: Local vs cloud LLMs, fine-tuning approaches
- **Data Privacy**: Local-first architecture vs cloud processing
- **Integration Layer**: APIs for calendar, email, document systems
- **User Interface**: Desktop app, web app, mobile, or browser extension
- **Real-time Processing**: For notifications and contextual suggestions

## User Experience & Personalization
- **Learning System**: How the AI adapts to individual work styles
- **Interaction Modalities**: Chat, voice, automation rules, smart suggestions
- **Onboarding**: How to train the system on user preferences initially
- **Trust & Transparency**: Explaining AI decisions and allowing user control

What's your primary use case? Are you building this for yourself, a specific industry, or as a general productivity tool?
