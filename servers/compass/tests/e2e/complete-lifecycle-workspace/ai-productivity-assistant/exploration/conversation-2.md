# Exploration Session 2
**Project:** ai-productivity-assistant
**Date:** 2025-06-26T12:41:00.539Z
**Session:** 2
**Summary:** Target user focus, privacy-first architecture, and technical implementation details

---

**USER:** I want to focus on knowledge workers in consulting and research roles. The system should be desktop-first with web backup, using local LLMs for privacy. Priority on document analysis and decision support.

**ASSISTANT:** Perfect focus! Consulting and research professionals have specific needs. Let me explore the targeted requirements:

## Target User Profile: Consultants & Researchers
**Daily Workflows:**
- Document-heavy research and analysis
- Client presentation preparation  
- Data synthesis from multiple sources
- Time-sensitive decision making
- Collaborative knowledge sharing

**Key Pain Points:**
- Information overload from multiple sources
- Difficulty tracking decision rationales over time
- Manual effort in document summarization
- Context switching between tools
- Maintaining confidentiality with client data

## Technical Architecture for Privacy-First Design
**Local-First Approach:**
- Ollama integration for local LLM inference
- SQLite database for knowledge storage
- Electron/Tauri desktop application
- Optional cloud sync for non-sensitive metadata only

**Document Processing Pipeline:**
- PDF, Word, PowerPoint parsing capabilities
- OCR for scanned documents and images
- Semantic chunking and embedding generation
- Local vector database (Chroma/Qdrant)

**Decision Support Features:**
- Framework templates (SWOT, decision trees, cost-benefit)
- Stakeholder analysis automation
- Risk assessment questionnaires
- Historical decision outcome tracking

## Implementation Considerations
**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: Electron + React/Vue for cross-platform desktop
- Backend: Node.js/Python for document processing
- AI: Ollama + Mistral/Llama models for local inference
- Database: SQLite + vector embeddings
- Security: End-to-end encryption for document storage

**MVP Scope:**
- Document upload and intelligent summarization
- Basic decision framework templates
- Simple task prioritization
- Search across personal knowledge base

What's your timeline and team size for this project? Are you planning to build this as open source or commercial?
