**Session:** 2
**Summary:** Fashion-specific requirements and technical considerations

---

**USER:** Based on our previous discussion, I want to focus on fashion items (clothing and accessories) for millennials and Gen Z, primarily B2C with some influencer partnerships.

**ASSISTANT:** Excellent! Fashion e-commerce for millennials/Gen Z has specific characteristics. Let me explore the key technical and business considerations:

**Technical Requirements:**
- Mobile-first design (80%+ of this demographic shops on mobile)
- Fast image loading and high-quality product photos
- Size recommendation engine
- AR/VR try-on features
- Social media integration for sharing
- Influencer collaboration tools

**Business Model Specifics:**
- Seasonal inventory management
- Returns and exchange policies (high return rates in fashion)
- Size chart standardization
- Trend forecasting integration
- Influencer commission tracking

**User Experience Priorities:**
- Visual search capabilities
- Outfit recommendations
- Social proof (reviews, user photos)
- Wishlist and favorites
- Quick reordering

What's your approach to inventory - will you hold stock, dropship, or use a hybrid model?
