**USER:** I want to build an e-commerce platform. What are the key areas I should explore?

**ASSISTANT:** Let's systematically explore the key areas for your e-commerce platform:

1. **Business Model & Requirements**
   - What type of products will you sell? (Physical, digital, services)
   - Will this be B2C, B2B, or marketplace?
   - What's your target market and customer personas?
   - Revenue model (direct sales, subscriptions, commissions)?

2. **Technical Architecture**
   - Expected scale (users, products, transactions per day)?
   - Mobile-first, web-first, or omnichannel?
   - Integration requirements (payment processors, shipping, inventory)?
   - Security and compliance needs (PCI DSS, GDPR, etc.)?

3. **User Experience & Journey**
   - Customer acquisition and onboarding flow
   - Product discovery and search capabilities
   - Shopping cart and checkout experience
   - Post-purchase experience and support

Let's start with the business model - can you tell me more about what you want to sell and who your target customers are?
